# Quant
## **Use the JoinQuant plantform.**
By using the ***Shiryaev-Zhou index***. I tried to create a single factor quant model which will buy when index > 0 for 3 consecutive trading days and sell when index < 0 and a two-factor quant model which will select the **top 10 smallest companies** and trade in the Shiryaev-Zhou index rule.
